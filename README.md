# Fake-News-Detector
A machine learning project to detect whether a given news article is fake or real using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.


📌 Project Overview
This project uses a labeled dataset of news articles to train a model that can classify news as fake or real. It applies text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification techniques to achieve this goal.
